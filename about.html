  <h1>About Luck of the Draw Golf</h1>
  <p>
    Golf has always been more than just a game to me — it’s a lifelong passion and a part of who I am.
    From early morning tee times to chasing that one perfect shot, I’ve always known I wanted to do something in the golf industry.
    Luck of the Draw Golf was born out of that love — a brand that reflects both the unpredictability of the game and the swagger that comes with playing it.

  <p>
    I didn’t start this to compete with the giants — I started it because I love the game and wanted to create something that felt true to it.
  Luck of the Draw isn’t about flashy gear or bold claims. It’s about representing the everyday golfer — the ones chasing one good shot, one solid round, and doing it with a little style.
  The name and the logo say everything I want the brand to stand for: passion, unpredictability, and maybe one nice draw.
